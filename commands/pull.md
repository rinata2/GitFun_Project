#git pull 

Similar to a [git push] (./push.md), a `git pull` will interact witha remote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote downto the local repository.

This means any commits made that are on the remote repository will be pulled down nad added to the local repository. 

This can be done by addin gthe remote name and branch name:established, you can use `git pull` without speicfying a remote or branch.
```
git pull origin main
```

if there is any upstream connection
