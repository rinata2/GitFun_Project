#git Add

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want ot keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command.

Items hat have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracke and all other changes willbe marked as modified.

generally, you can get away with the command `gitadd .` whcih will add ALL files and directories that were added, changed or deleted.

You can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will track speifically file1 and file2.

you can specify tracking directories with `git add DiretoryName`.
