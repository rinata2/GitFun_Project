# git status

the command `git status` is extremely helpful when it ome to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

Using ` git status` will show you what changesare being tracked, aren't being traced, what commits need to pushed/pulled, etc. It is exactly waht it sounds like, a status check.
git 
It's a command that is safe to use at anytime. If you want to see what is going on it's good to use `git status` in between commands until you get to know the flow better. 

````
git add. 
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status

git push
